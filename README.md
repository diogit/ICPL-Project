================================

Everything is implemented.

There are two modes: console and file.
Console mode: Evaluates one program inputted into the console at a time
File mode: Evaluates multiple programs from a single file

To enter file mode just provide a path to a test file. A premade file has been 
provided in /tests. Otherwise the program starts in console mode by default.

Usage: java Main "../tests/MultipleTests.txt"
